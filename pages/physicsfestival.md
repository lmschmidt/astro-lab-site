Every spring, the Department of Physics and Astronomy and the Department of Aerospace Engineering host a Physics and Engineering Festival. The festival invites people of all ages to participate in fun experiments, listen to talks from our world-famous professors, and learn something new!

To learn more about the Physics Festival, please visit [their website](http://physicsfestival.tamu.edu/).

Below, you will find posters created by the Astronomy group that explain some of the experiments we helped put on. Enjoy!
