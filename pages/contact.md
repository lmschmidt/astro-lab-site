## Visiting the Lab

The Astronomical Instrumentation Lab is not open to the public. If you are visiting the lab we have the following parking recommendations.  There are several locations with guest parking and a kiosk for payment.

[Campus Parking Map](https://transport.tamu.edu/parkingmap//tsmap.htm?map=main)

This map shows all of the locations, anywhere with a blue 'P' has a visitor pay kiosk. First choice is the [North Side Garage](https://transport.tamu.edu/parkingmap/tsmap.htm?map=timed&cit=20100), as it is right next to the lab, however depending on when you arrive, it can be very busy or full. 

There is also a [city parking garage](https://goo.gl/maps/u3aRZwH6P7817f71A) that is a relatively short walk.

Lot [30c](https://transport.tamu.edu/parkingmap/tsmap.htm?map=main&cit=03003), or the [post office lot](https://transport.tamu.edu/parkingmap/tsmap.htm?map=main&cit=21070) are also fairly close to the lab, but they have limited visitor spots (15 spaces and 23 spaces, respectively).
