## Overview
The Visible Integral-Field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) instrument is being built at Texas A&M University in collaboration with University of Texas--Austin. [VIRUS](http://hetdex.org/hetdex/virus.php) is the instrument that enables observations for the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment [HETDEX project](http://hetdex.org/), an experiment designed to learn more about Dark Energy--a mysterious force in our Universe that astronomers are only now beginning to be able to describe.

The VIRUS instrument consists of up to 192 identical fiber-fed integral field optical spectrographs. VIRUS provides a unique challenge in astronomical instrumentation: each of the 192 instruments must be identical and each component must be interchangeable amongst every other spectrograph in order to ease assembly and maintenance of the instrument. The spectrographs will be assembled production-line-stye, and will be optically aligned and tested at Texas A&M before being shipped to McDonald Observatory to be installed on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope.

## VIRUS Enclosures
The Visible Integral-Field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) instrument will be installed at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope in the near future. The instrument will be housed in two enclosures that are mounted adjacent to the telescope, via the VIRUS Support Structure (VSS). The enclosures have been designed to support and protect the instrument, to enable servicing of the instrument, and to cool the instrument appropriately while not adversely affecting the dome environment. The system uses simple HVAC air handling techniques in conjunction with thermoelectric and standard glycol heat exchangers to provide efficient heat removal. The enclosures also provide power and data transfer to and from each VIRUS unit, liquid nitrogen cooling to the detectors, and environmental monitoring of the instrument and dome environments.

Light from the fibers enters the instrument and is collimated by the oblong spherical collimator mirrors (upper center left). The light is reflected by a folding flat located around the fiber feed (center right), and into the grating (lower center left) which is mounted in front of the vacuum Schmidt cameras (left).</figcaption>

## VIRUS Collimators
The Visual Integral-Field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) instrument is a baseline array of 150 identical fiber fed optical spectrographs designed to support observations for the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX). 130 VIRUS collimator sub-assemblies have been assembled in a production line and are now complete. Here we review the design choices and assembly practices used to produce a suite of identical low-cost spectrographs in a timely fashion using primarily unskilled labor.
