## Introduction
<a href="https://mse.cfht.hawaii.edu" target="_blank">Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE)</a> is the first of the future generation of massively multiplexed spectroscopic facilities.  MSE is designed to enable transformative science, being completely dedicated to large-scale multi-object spectroscopic surveys, each studying thousands to millions of astrophysical objects. MSE uses an 11.25 m aperture telescope to feed 4,332 fibers over a wide 1.52 square degree field of view.  It will have the capabilities to observe at a range of spectral resolutions, from R~3,000 to R~40,000, with all spectral resolutions available at all times and across the entire field, and an on-target observing efficiency of more than 80%. With these capabilities, MSE will be able to collect a number of spectra equivalent to an entire SDSS Legacy Survey every eight weeks, but is designed to excel at precision studies of faint astrophysical phenomena.
