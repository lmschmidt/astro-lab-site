## Introduction
<a href="https://mse.cfht.hawaii.edu" target="_blank">Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE)</a> is the first of the future generation of massively multiplexed spectroscopic facilities.  MSE is designed to enable transformative science, being completely dedicated to large-scale multi-object spectroscopic surveys, each studying thousands to millions of astrophysical objects. MSE uses an 11.25 m aperture telescope to feed 4,332 fibers over a wide 1.52 square degree field of view.  It will have the capabilities to observe at a range of spectral resolutions, from R~3,000 to R~40,000, with all spectral resolutions available at all times and across the entire field, and an on-target observing efficiency of more than 80%. With these capabilities, MSE will be able to collect a number of spectra equivalent to an entire SDSS Legacy Survey every eight weeks, but is designed to excel at precision studies of faint astrophysical phenomena.

In order to maximize the scientific return of MSE, a robust calibration system and calibration pipleline is required.  SCal is the collection of light sources, optics, projection systems, and monitoring systems that will inject both broadband and wavelength calibration light sources into the telescope/spectrographs and also monitor the telescope field of view for transient phenomena (satellites, airplanes, etc.).

This conceptual design is ongoing (Nov. 2020 - Nov. 2021) and the sections below will be updated as the study progresses.
