*The Observatory at Cord贸n Mac贸n, in the remote Atacama region of northwestern Argentina.*

## Introduction
The Transient Optical Robotic Observatory of the South, [(TOROS)](https://toros.utrgv.edu/) is being developed as a facility to detect and characterize transient astronomical phenomena including electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave sources. It will operate robotically and is expected to be fully operational in 2021.

## Site
Located at Cord贸n Mac贸n in Salta Province, Argentina, 4660 m elevation.

## Telescope, Corrector, and Filters
The telescope is a [Planewave CDK24](http://planewave.com/products-page/telescopes/24-inch-cdk-optical-tube-assembly/) (*f*/6.5 Corrected Dall-Kirkham)

The PlaneWave CDK24 will be modified to include a tertiary mirror, three N-BK7 corrector lenses, a fold mirror, and filters (LSST g,r,i,z, and 550-950 nm broadband).

## Detector
The TOROS detector is a STA1600LN a 10560 x 10560 pixel (9 &mu;m) CCD with a 95.04mm x 95.04mm image area. Plate scale is 0.47"/px with a 1.9 square degree field of view.
