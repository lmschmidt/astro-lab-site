## Darren DePoy
<img src="../people/assets/DarrenDePoy_1.jpg" width="150" alt="Darren Depoy" class="profile"/> [Darren DePoy](http://physics.tamu.edu/people/depoy) is the Rachal/Mitchell/Heep endowed professor of Physics and Astronomy and is the head of the Astronomical Instrumentation Lab. He came to Texas A&M in 2008 after working at The Ohio State University for 18 years, where he was the Vice-Chair for Instrumentation. Dr. DePoy has designed and built state-of-the-art optical and infrared astronomical instruments for telescopes all over the world, including OSIRIS currently on the SOAR telescope in Chile, TIFKAM at the MDM Observatory in Arizona, ANDICam at the Cerro-Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO) in Chile, DANDICam at South African Astronomical Observatory, MODS on the LBT telescope in Arizona, a new instrument called [DECam](http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/DeCal.html) for the CTIO 4-meter telescope, and [VIRUS](http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/virus.html), the instrument that supports the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment.
## Jennifer Marshall
<img src="../people/assets/marshall.jpg" width="150" alt="Jennifer Marshall" class="profile"/> [Jennifer Marshall](http://physics.tamu.edu/people/jlm076) manages the day-to-day operations of the Astronomical Instrumentation Lab. Professor Marshall's background is in instrumentation, having earned a Ph.D. in instrumentation and observational astronomy in 2006. She is the lead for Texas A&Mâ€™s involvement in the VIRUS project, is a co-PI on the Giant Magellan Telescope Wide-Field Optical Spectrograph ([GMACS](/instruments/gmacs/)), and is generally involved in all other ongoing activities in the lab.

## Travis Prochaska
<img src="../people/assets/TravisProchaska3.jpg" width="150" alt="Travis Prochaska" class="profile"/> [Travis Prochaska](http://physics.tamu.edu/people/tprochaska/) is the Senior Mechanical Engineer Specialist in the Astronomy Instrumentation Lab at Texas A&M University. Since the beginning of 2010 he has worked on the vast majority of the mechanical and opto-mechanical needs of the lab. This includes designing, building and verifying systems for telescopes, spectrographs and calibration systems for the HET Dark Energy Experiment ([HETDEX](http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/instruments/hetdex/)), Dark Energy Camera ([DECam](http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/instruments/decal/)), Giant Magellan Telescope ([GMT](http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/instruments/gmt/)) projects along with various smaller projects. Travis also manages several students each semester, who assist him many assembly, fabrication and design tasks. He currently works on the new [GMACS](http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/instruments/gmacs/) spectrograph conceptual design, a proposed instrument for the Giant Magellan Telescope. On this project, he oversees the design of the structure, mechanisms and optics housings.
## Luke Schmidt
<img src="../people/assets/lschmidt_headshot.jpg" width="150" alt="Luke Schmidt" class="profile"/> [Luke Schmidt](https://physics.tamu.edu/people/lschmidt/) is an Assistant Research Scientist in the Astronomical Instrumentation Lab where he works on a variety of projects, including development of [GMACS](http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/instruments/gmacs/), the Giant Magellan Telescope Wide-Field Optical Spectrograph. Dr. Schmidt has been involved with the development of several other optical and infrared astronomical instruments including AMASING (Aperture Masking And Speckle ImagiNG), NESSI (New Mexico Exoplanet Spectroscopic Survey Instrument) both at the Magdalena Ridge Observatory 2.4m Telescope. Before coming to Texas A&M he was an Instrumentation Scientist with the Magdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer project. There he helped develop ICoNN, the Infrared Coherencing Nearest Neighbor fringe tracker as well as several other subsystems related to beam transport and automated alignment.
## Erika Cook
