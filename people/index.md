## Darren DePoy
<img src="../people/assets/darren_depoy.jpg" width="150" style='margin-top:6px' alt="Darren Depoy" class="profile"/> [Darren DePoy](http://physics.tamu.edu/people/depoy) is the Rachal/Mitchell/Heep endowed professor of Physics and Astronomy and is the head of the Astronomical Instrumentation Lab. He came to Texas A&M in 2008 after working at The Ohio State University for 18 years, where he was the Vice-Chair for Instrumentation. Dr. DePoy has designed and built state-of-the-art optical and infrared astronomical instruments for telescopes all over the world, including OSIRIS currently on the SOAR telescope in Chile, TIFKAM at the MDM Observatory in Arizona, ANDICam at the Cerro-Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO) in Chile, DANDICam at South African Astronomical Observatory, MODS on the LBT telescope in Arizona, a new instrument called [DECam](/instruments/decal) for the CTIO 4-meter telescope, and [VIRUS](http://hetdex.org/hetdex/virus.html), the instrument that supports the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment.
## Jennifer Marshall
<img src="../people/assets/jennifer_marshall.jpg" width="150" style='margin-top:6px' alt="Jennifer Marshall" class="profile"/> [Jennifer Marshall](http://physics.tamu.edu/people/jlm076) is an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Texas A&M University. She currently serves as the Project Scientist for the [Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer](/instruments/mse/) project, a next-generation massively multiplexed spectroscopic survey.  Her scientific interests include the study of near-field cosmology, specifically using metal-poor stars found in the halo of the Milky Way to better understand the formation mechanisms of the Galaxy and of the Universe as a whole. Most recently she has focused on studying the detailed kinematics and chemistry of satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, particularly those that have been discovered by the [Dark Energy Survey](/instruments/des/). In the past she led Texas A&Mâ€™s involvement in the Dark Energy Survey, producing the calibration systems that enable the unprecedentedly precise photometric measurements produced by the survey, and also in the HETDEX project, building the [VIRUS](http://hetdex.org/hetdex/virus.html) spectrographs. She is the co-PI of [GMACS](/instruments/gmacs/), the wide field multi-object spectrograph that will be a first-light instrument for the Giant Magellan Telescope.

## Luke Schmidt
<img src="../people/assets/luke_schmidt.jpg" width="150" style='margin-top:6px' alt="Luke Schmidt" class="profile"/> [Luke Schmidt](https://physics.tamu.edu/people/lschmidt/) is an Assistant Research Scientist in the Astronomical Instrumentation Lab where he helps manage the day-to-day activities of the lab and fills various roles in the lab instrumentation projects including management, optical and opto-mechanical design, detectors, and control systems. Dr. Schmidt has been involved with the development of several other optical and infrared astronomical instruments including AMASING (Aperture Masking And Speckle ImagiNG), NESSI (New Mexico Exoplanet Spectroscopic Survey Instrument) both at the Magdalena Ridge Observatory 2.4m Telescope. Before coming to Texas A&M he was an Instrumentation Scientist with the Magdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer project. There he helped develop ICoNN, the Infrared Coherencing Nearest Neighbor fringe tracker as well as several other subsystems related to beam transport and automated alignment.
## Erika Cook
